# XOR Neural Network in C

This is assignment 1

## Compile & Run

 ```sh
 #Compile
 make all
 #Run
 ./main
  ```

## Input
 ```sh
1. Enter a 2-100 bit binary number(without space) ex: 00 or 1011 or 11010100
2. Press enter to get the output
3. If your input is not correct you will get a "Input error,try again"output
4. Please input again with the right form(check 1.)
5. if you want to stop enter testing sets,type $ to exit
 ```
 
## Outputs
 ```sh
 1. You will first see the total loss through epochs when running the program
 2. Then you will see the result and the absolute error of the training set  
 3. Input when seeing"Please enter testing set with binary numbers(2-100bit):"
 4.After pressing enter you will see the output of XOR 
 ```
